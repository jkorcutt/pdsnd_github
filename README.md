### Project Title
United States Bikeshare Analysis

### Description
This project is the Python part of the Udacity's Programming for Data Science Nanodegree.  The script requests user input to generate statistics about the bikeshare program in three cities: Chicago, New York City and Washington, DC.  The statistics describe the activity for the first six months of 2017, and define the following:  Popular Times of Travel, Popular Stations, Trip Duration, and for Chicago and New York City, Gender and Year of Birth statistics are included.



### Files used
chicago.csv   
new_york_city.csv   
washington.csv   

### Credits
While the dataset files were provided by Motivate, a New York City based company that operations bike share systems across the United States, Udacity provided the motivation, and training, to explore the data.
